Distributed Computing Project: Amazon CDs and Vinyl Reviews

This project is part of our Distributed Computing class, we chose to analyze customer reviews of CDs and vinyl records left on Amazon. Using PySpark, we leverage distributed computing techniques to process and analyze large datasets, with a focus on exploring machine learning and potentially incorporating large language models (LLMs) for deeper insights.
Project Overview

    Dataset: Amazon reviews for CDs and vinyl records.
    Tools: PySpark for distributed data processing, with plans to use machine learning models and possibly LLMs for advanced analysis.
    Objective: TBD — we’re currently exploring ideas, but some possibilities include:
        Sentiment analysis of reviews.
        Topic modeling to uncover common themes in reviews.
        Building a recommendation system for music genres.
        Comparing the popularity of CDs versus vinyl records.
